### What is this?

It's a collection of Windows `.ico` files.

### Where'd you get them?

Various places. Some collections from the [win_icons](https://twitter.com/win_icons) Twitter bot that Foone runs, manual labor, leaks...

### What are they exactly?

* `3000`, `fantazia`, `iconart`, and `iconlib` are collections from the bot.
  * `fantazia/improved` is me going through the `fantazia` set and adding transparency, because it appears their icon tool didn't support those.
* I forget where `iconpak` comes from, but you'll notice they're much larger than the usual 32Ã—32.
* `mac` is hand-converted icons from MacOS 7.5 and the Appearance extension that makes it look more like 8, plus Word. All but Word's are named according to their resource number.
* `moricons` is mostly the actual contents of the classic `moricons.dll` with the original names from a Windows source leak, plus a few unnamed icons from a later version.
* `other-win` is literally "other Windows icons".
* `progman` is much like `moricons`, named the same way
* `sierra` is a collection of icon files that came with various Sierra On-Line adventure games.
* `tabworks` is some dumb utility that Foone came across that's also in the bot's corpus.
* `vb` is the collection of sample icons from Visual Basic 3.
* The *other* icons are...
  * A dumb idea I had when I spotted Program Manager on the bot and had *Avengers* on the brain.
  * A better take on Grover from *Sesame Street* because the one in `iconlib` pissed me off.
  * A better take on *Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure* because the one in `3000` freaked out Foone.
  * A better take on *Leisure Suit Larry* because the one in `iconlib` pissed me off.
  * A better take on *Police Quest 2* because the one in `3000` pissed me off.
  * Kamen Rider #1, from a Game Boy game.
  * Kirby, from a Game Boy game and then hand-upscaled and colored.
  * A simple Pac-Man that I drew to get back into the swing of things when I restored my favorite icon editor.
  * A rather beautiful Sierra logo, one of the few if only full-size full-size icons in the set.
  * A Double Trouble portrait, from *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power*, because they are an enby icon and now that's literal.
  * Lenna.
